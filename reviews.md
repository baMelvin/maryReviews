# La Costa Mexican Restaurant - Reviews Mentioning Mary

## Steve Acevedo (1 year ago)

I eat out often, and I seriously cannot remember when we've had better service from a server/waitress. Mary was absolutely delightful and attendant without being intrusive. She couldn't have been more charming or professional. LaCosta has a gem in Mary.

One of our favorite places to eat, never disappoints. Mary is awesome, and the fried ice cream they provide for birthday celebrations is incredible. A family tradition.

We eat at the AF location often, and it's great. We love Mary!!! She is so pleasant and always greets us with a smile. She always remembers what we like to eat and drink. It's like visiting friends each time we go. We appreciate the quality of the food. Best carne asada, rice, and beans in town!

We love La Costa. It is a warm, family-friendly environment. They serve complimentary chips and salsa with a bean dip as well, which is super yummy. All of the entrees I have tried are delicious and of generous portions. Our server, Mary, was so attentive and personable. She made our visit extra special. La Costa is one of our favorite go-to places.
